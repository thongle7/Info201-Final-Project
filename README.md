# INFO201 - Final Project - Team %>% Squad
  Our project focus is on presenting the data of mass shootings in United States with a geographical map and histograms by showing when, where, and the frequency of mass shootings in the U.S.  By analyzing such data, further data sets and inferences can be concluded, whether it be about the trends of firearms in each state, or correlations between an individual's ability to obtain a firearm in a specific state, or more.

  We will be using data sets directly pertaining to mass shooting across the United States, and we define mass shootings as an incident(s) where 4 or more people are injured or killed.  Our goal is to be able to convey information that the public can use to understand related data analytics, and/or form their own opinions and create further inferences of other data sets if needed.  The data presented should help raise awareness about gun violence and other sensitive topics relative to the U.S. 


## Project Description/Purpose
  The 'Incidents Map' tab allows the user to view areas of the United States where mass shootings are commonly grouped.  Each bubble is represented by a numer and color, reflecting on the number of individuals dead or injured and frequency of events, respectively.  Upon clicking on a bubble will zone in closer on the area of events and further display the information about the incidents.  Clicking on a blue marker displays the precise incident information including address, date, and number of casualties.  There is a select box and sliders to help filter the mass shooting events by year and frequency of individuals affected.  The 'Histograms' and 'Frequency' tabs display the information from the Incidents Map in the form of bar graphics.  Similarly, there are select boxes and sliders to narrow the search.


## Data Set Information
  The data used was collected by the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), accessible at http://www.shootingtracker.com/, and reflects mass shooting incidents in the United States alone from 2013 - 2017.  There are five separate static CSV files for the data compiled.  GVA ensures each shooting incident is “verified by both initial researchers and secondary validation processes", and their methods for obtaining the data includes “utilizing automated queries, manual research through over 2,000 media sources, aggregates, police blotters, police media outlets and other sources daily.”  Upon going to the source of information at http://www.shootingtracker.com/, you are introduced with links to each shooting incident, which includes an incident report to provide "information on each incident for researchers, advocate groups, media and legislative interests" in the form of online web articles.  We found these data sets to be very credible and reputable.
