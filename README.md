# Info201-Final-Project

Our project focus on presenting the data of mass shooting in United States. Through analyzing the data, we will be able to get a good idea of the trends of obtaining a firearm in each state. The amount of mass shootings would be correlated with ones ability to obtain a firearm in a specified state.

## Project Description 
  We will be using datasets pertaining to mass shooting across the United States, to be able to convey information that the public can use to form their own opinions and create further inferences and other data sets if needed.  The mass shooting data sets we are using is collected by the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) and is publicly accessible at  http://www.shootingtracker.com/.  The data reflects solely on the mass shooting incidents in the United States from 2013 - Present.  GVA’s methods for obtaining their data includes “utilizing automated queries, manual research through over 2,000 media sources, aggregates, police blotters, police media outlets and other sources daily.”  Furthermore, each shooting incident is “verified by both initial researchers and secondary validation processes. Links to each incident are included in the incident report to provide further information on each incident for researchers, advocate groups, media and legislative interests. The incident reports provide a starting point for researchers, media and legislative interests to add texture to our raw data” (Gun Violence Archive).
  Due to the fact that our intended target audience is the general public, we want to be able to present data and raise awareness about gun violence and other sensitive related topics using the data of mass shootings in the U.S.  To home in on one particular audience, we would chose those who are/have been directly affected by gun violence, and to be able to show them such data that they can interpret as desired.
  We would like our audience to learn the analytics behind mass shootings in the United States, and to gain more knowledge whether it be underlying factors related to gun control or over-the-head details about the mass shootings occurring in the United States.  All information surrounding the topic of mass shootings is important and critical.
Questions that our project will be answering are:
1. How far apart each mass shooting is from each other?
2. Where are the most frequent and its location(s) of mass shootings in the United States?
3. On average, how often does a mass shooting occur in the United States?
4. Analyzing different patterns between different mass shootings will help our audience observe correlations with other related data. 
5. Describing the areas where mass shootings occur aids our audience in understanding gun control laws.

## Technical Description
  We will be compiling our data for our final product in the format of an HTML page.  The data compiled will be from the static .csv that can be downloaded from http://www.shootingtracker.com/ for years between 2013 - 2017.  The 2018 dataset might also be used, but is not a static list because it is still being updated as the year continues.  And in order to utilize our data most efficiently, we might need to reformat the layout of the data sets and remove unnecessary data, which could include physical street address, date, and/or the city.  We will also need to import libraries ggplot2 and dplyr, but is subject to change as the project progresses.
  Statistical analysis and machine learning will help us answer questions and trends where mass shootings can occur.  Statistical analysis will also help answer how citizens are able to obtain guns with the different gun laws from the differing states in which they reside, and possibly how this information might explain the frequency of shootings in a particular area.
  Challenges we anticipate include: possible null values with datasets, and being able to effectively interpret this information without harming the credibility of the information.  We are also trusting that GVA is providing truthful and accurate information given the source of the data, but there is always the possibility that information could be misleading or inaccurate.
